## We Have A Main Func: Evaluate
## Evaluate(Plan,"Name Of Pattern")
## Evaluate(Room,"Name Of Pattern")
## etc...
## Each Evaluation, Return 2 things:(maybe a class)
## ( Pattern Code , Pattern Score )
## Pattern Score:
## 1: Pattern Is OK!!
## [0,1) : Pattern is not considered, But, We have an indicator to see how much pattern is considered or not
## This is crucial because we need to evaluate plans in Genetic Algorithm

def Evaluate(PatternCode, EvaluateMaterial):
	pass


def Scoring(Plan):
	pass
